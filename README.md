## Objective:

The objective of a Power BI project using the unemployment data provided in the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/unemployment-in-america-per-us-state is  to create a dashboard that provides insights into unemployment trends for different US states. The dashboard should include various KPIs and visualizations to help the user understand and analyze the data. Some possible objectives for this project could be:

To analyze the unemployment rates across different US states and identify states with high or low unemployment rates.

To track the unemployment trends over time by month and year and identify any patterns or trends.

To compare the unemployment rates across different demographic groups and identify any disparities or trends.

To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the unemployment rates across different US states and demographic groups.

To forecast the future unemployment rates based on the historical data trends and make data-driven decisions.

=================================================================================================
## Scope:

### Data Source:
Unemployment data is available in a CSV file containing information on unemployment by month and state.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
The dashboard should display the following KPIs:

Unemployment rate by state.

Top 5 states with highest unemployment rate.

Unemployment trends by year and month

### Visualization Requirements:
The dashboard should include the following visualizations:

Map to display unemployment rate by state.

Bar chart to display top 5 states with highest unemployment rate.

Line chart to display unemployment trends by year and month.

=====================================================================================================================================

## Steps:
### Step 1: Connect to Data

Download the CSV file from the link and connect to it in Power BI. Transform and shape the data to meet the requirements of the dashboard. For this example, we'll convert the Month column to a date format and add a column for Year.

### Step 2: Create Data Model

To create a data model in Power BI that includes the required tables, relationships, and measures. For this example, i will create a table for Unemployment that includes columns for State, Date, Year, and Unemployment Rate.

### Step 3: Design the Dashboard

Design the dashboard using the required visualizations and layout. Include any required filters and slicers. 

### Step 4: Add Interactivity

Add interactivity to the dashboard using filters, slicers, and drill-through actions. For this i will include a slicer to filter by year and a drill-through action to see the details of a specific state.

### Step 5: Apply Formatting

Apply formatting to the visualizations, including colors, fonts, and styles. For this i will use a Dark color scheme and a modern font.

### Step 6: Add Calculations and Measures

Add any required calculations and measures to the data model. For this i will add a measure to calculate the unemployment rate and another measure to calculate the unemployment rate by state.
